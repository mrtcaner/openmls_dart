/// Release a new `openmls_frb` native crate version.
///
/// Bumps `rust/Cargo.toml`, stamps the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` Highlights line,
/// creates a signed commit + signed tag `openmls_frb-<version>`, and pushes
/// (unless `--no-push`). The tag triggers the native build workflow, which
/// publishes the platform binaries. This is stage 1 of the two-stage release
/// flow (see CLAUDE.md); the Dart package release is stage 2.
///
/// The commit/tag/push run with an inherited terminal, so you enter your
/// signing passphrase interactively during the command — no separate manual
/// commit/tag step. A failed signing step is retried automatically — the error
/// is printed and the passphrase is asked for again, with Ctrl-C as the way out.
/// A failed push stops normally, and a run interrupted after its commit is
/// resumed by re-running the same command.
///
/// Usage:
///   make release-frb ARGS="--version X.Y.Z"
///   make release-frb ARGS="--version X.Y.Z --no-push"
///   make release-frb ARGS="--version X.Y.Z --yes"

Release a new openmls_frb native crate version

Usage:
  make release-frb ARGS="--version X.Y.Z [options]"

Options:
  --version <X.Y.Z>  New crate version [required]
  --no-push          Commit and tag locally, but do not push
  --yes, -y          Skip the confirmation prompt
  --help, -h         Show this help

What it does:
  1. Verifies you are on a clean, up-to-date main.
  2. Bumps the [package] version in rust/Cargo.toml.
  3. Stamps the "openmls_frb vX.Y.Z" line into CHANGELOG [Unreleased].
  4. Creates a SIGNED commit and SIGNED tag "openmls_frb-X.Y.Z"
     (you enter your passphrase during the command).
  5. Pushes main and the tag, which triggers the native build workflow.

If a signing step fails — a mistyped passphrase is the usual cause, and signing
tools do not re-prompt on their own — it is run again, so the passphrase prompt
comes back. Press Ctrl-C to give up. A push failure stops normally rather than
retrying a protected-branch rejection forever. Re-run the same command to resume
at the tag/push step.

After the native build succeeds, cut the Dart package release (stage 2).
