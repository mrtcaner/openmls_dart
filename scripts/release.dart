/// Release a new Dart package version (publish to pub.dev).

/// Verifies the stage-1 native release exists, validates with `make
/// publish-dry-run` (clean pre-bump tree), bumps `pubspec.yaml`, finalizes the
/// CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z]`, creates a signed commit + signed tag
/// `vX.Y.Z`, and pushes (unless `--no-push`). The tag triggers `publish.yml`,
/// which publishes to

/// The commit/tag/push run with an inherited terminal, so you enter your

/// Usage:

Release a new Dart package version (publish to pub.dev)

Usage:
  make release ARGS="--version X.Y.Z [options]"

Options:
  --version <X.Y.Z>  New package version [required]
  --no-push          Commit and tag locally, but do not push
  --yes, -y          Skip the confirmation prompt
  --skip-frb-check   Skip the stage-1 native-binary existence check
                     (only if you have verified it manually)
  --date <Y-M-D>     CHANGELOG date to stamp (default: today)
  --help, -h         Show this help

What it does:
  1. Verifies you are on a clean, up-to-date main.
  2. Verifies the stage-1 native release openmls_frb-<crate version> exists
     on GitHub Releases (the published build hook downloads it).
  3. Validates the package with `make publish-dry-run` on the clean, pre-bump
     tree (dry-run exits non-zero on any warning, so it runs before the bump).
  4. Bumps the version in pubspec.yaml.
  5. Finalizes CHANGELOG: [Unreleased] -> [X.Y.Z] - <date> and updates the
     compare links at the bottom (no empty [Unreleased] is left behind — the
     next unreleased change recreates it).
  6. Creates a SIGNED commit and SIGNED tag "vX.Y.Z" (you enter your passphrase
     during the command).
  7. Pushes main and the tag, which triggers the pub.dev publish workflow.

This is stage 2. Run stage 1 first (make release-frb) and let its native build
finish, so the binary exists before the published package downloads it.
