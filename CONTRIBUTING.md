## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and considerate of others. We expect all contributors to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (3.10.0+)
- Git
- **For running tests:** Rust toolchain (1.88+)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/openmls_dart.git
   cd openmls_dart
   ```
3. Add upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/djx-y-z/openmls_dart.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Run the setup command to install everything automatically:

```bash
make setup
```

This will:
1. Check that Rust toolchain is installed (shows instructions if not)
2. Install FVM (Flutter Version Management) and project's Flutter version
3. Install cargo-audit for Rust dependency vulnerability scanning
4. Install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen for binding generation
5. Get all dependencies

### Verify Setup

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Run tests to ensure everything works
make test
```

### Windows Users

On Windows, you need to install `make` first:
- Via Chocolatey: `choco install make`
- Via Scoop: `scoop install make`
- Or use Git Bash / WSL

Then run `make setup` as above.

## Making Changes

### Create a Branch

Create a branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### Types of Contributions

We welcome:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix issues in existing code
- **Documentation** - Improve docs, examples, comments
- **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage
- **Features** - New functionality (please discuss first)
- **Performance** - Optimizations with benchmarks

### Before You Start

For major changes:
1. Open an issue first to discuss the change
2. Wait for feedback from maintainers
3. This helps avoid wasted effort on changes that won't be merged

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
make test ARGS="test/group_lifecycle_test.dart"

# Run with verbose output
make test ARGS="--reporter=expanded"
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `test/` directory
- Name test files with `_test.dart` suffix
- Test both success and error cases
- Include edge cases for protocol operations

Example test structure:

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import 'package:openmls/openmls.dart';

void main() {
  group('Group creation', () {
    test('creates group with default config', () async {
      await Openmls.init();
      final engine = await MlsEngine.create(
        dbPath: ':memory:',
        encryptionKey: Uint8List(32),
      );
      final ciphersuite = MlsCiphersuite.mls128DhkemX25519Aes128GcmSha256Ed25519;
      final keyPair = MlsSignatureKeyPair.generate(ciphersuite: ciphersuite);
      final signerBytes = serializeSigner(
        ciphersuite: ciphersuite,
        privateKey: keyPair.privateKey(),
        publicKey: keyPair.publicKey(),
      );

      final result = await engine.createGroup(
        config: MlsGroupConfig.defaultConfig(ciphersuite: ciphersuite),
        signerBytes: signerBytes,
        credentialIdentity: utf8.encode('alice'),
        signerPublicKey: keyPair.publicKey(),
      );

      expect(result.groupId, isNotEmpty);
    });
  });
}
```

### PR Checklist

Before submitting:

- [ ] Code follows the project's coding standards
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`make test`)
- [ ] Static analysis passes (`make analyze`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`make format-check`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated for user-facing changes
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and follow conventions

## Coding Standards

### Dart Style

Follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart) guidelines:

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Check formatting without changes
make format-check

# Run static analysis
make analyze
```

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Memory Safety (FRB Architecture)

This library uses Flutter Rust Bridge (FRB) with OpenMLS (pure Rust):

- **Memory is managed automatically** by Rust's ownership system
- **No manual cleanup needed** - FRB handles all resource deallocation
- **No `dispose()` calls** - Rust drops resources when they go out of scope

When adding a Rust API function, first choose the storage boundary it belongs
to. Do not make one operation write through both boundaries.

For `MlsEngine` methods:

- Return `Result<T, String>` for error handling (FRB converts to Dart exceptions)
- Methods on `MlsEngine` access storage via `self.db` (EncryptedDb)
- Storage is loaded into a SnapshotStorageProvider, operated on, then saved back

Example Rust API:

```rust
impl MlsEngine {
    pub async fn my_new_function(
        &self,
        group_id_bytes: Vec<u8>,
    ) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String> {
        let (provider, group) = self.load_for_group(&group_id_bytes).await?;
        // ... operate on group using provider ...
        self.commit(&provider, Some(&group_id_bytes)).await?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

For caller-owned storage functions in `rust/src/api/storage.rs`:

- keep each function operation-scoped; do not retain a provider or group object
- accept all required opaque entries plus `mlsStorageFormatVersion()`
- return one complete `MlsStorageBatch` only after success
- perform no durable I/O; encryption and atomic commit belong to the host
- validate caller-supplied security context before returning a mutation batch
- add success, discard/retry, mismatch, and missing-state tests in
  `test/external_storage_test.dart`

After either API surface changes, run `make codegen` and review the generated
Dart and Rust diffs before testing.

### Regenerating FRB Bindings

When modifying Rust API code in `rust/src/api/`:

```bash
# Regenerate Flutter Rust Bridge bindings
make codegen

# Test the new bindings
make test
```

**When to regenerate:**
- After modifying Rust API code in `rust/src/api/`
- After updating OpenMLS version (if API changed)

### Updating Upstream OpenMLS

**Automatic (CI):** A daily workflow checks for new OpenMLS releases and creates PRs.

**Manual update:**

```bash
# 1. Check for updates
make check-new-openmls-version

# 2. Apply update
make check-new-openmls-version ARGS="--update"

# 3. Update Cargo.lock
make rust-update

# 4. Regenerate bindings (if API changed)
make codegen

# 5. Update CHANGELOG (requires AI_MODELS_TOKEN)
AI_MODELS_TOKEN=xxx make update-changelog ARGS="--version vX.Y.Z"

# 6. Test
make test
```

### Setting up AI Changelog

To enable AI-powered changelog generation in CI:

1. Create a Personal Access Token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Required permission: **Models -> Read only**
3. Add as repository secret: Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> `AI_MODELS_TOKEN`

### Setting up Coverage Badge

CI measures test coverage, but badge publication is currently disabled in
`.github/workflows/test.yml`. The previous configuration failed because this
fork had no `GIST_TOKEN` or `COVERAGE_GIST_ID`, and the README had no badge.
To enable publication deliberately:

1. Create a **public** GitHub Gist at https://gist.github.com
   - Filename: `coverage.json`
   - Content: `{"schemaVersion":1,"label":"coverage","message":"0%","color":"red"}`
2. Copy the **Gist ID** from the URL (e.g., `https://gist.github.com/username/abc123` → `abc123`)
3. Create a **Fine-grained Personal Access Token** at https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
   - Required permission: **Gists → Read and write**
4. Add as repository secret: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret → `GIST_TOKEN`
5. Add as repository variable: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables → New repository variable → `COVERAGE_GIST_ID` (value: the Gist ID from step 2)
6. Add the matching badge to `README.md`
7. Change the workflow's `update-badge` input from `false` to the intended branch condition

### Setting up pub.dev Publishing

The publish workflow uses OIDC authentication to publish to pub.dev without tokens. This requires a one-time setup.

**On pub.dev:**

1. Go to https://pub.dev and sign in
2. Navigate to your publisher page (or create one)
3. Go to **Admin** → **Automated publishing**
4. Click **Enable automated publishing**
5. Add your GitHub repository: `mrtcaner/openmls_dart`
6. Set **Publishing from**: **GitHub Actions with tag** → tag pattern: `v*`

See [dart.dev/tools/pub/automated-publishing](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/automated-publishing) for details.

**On GitHub (create environment):**

1. Go to your repository → **Settings → Environments**
2. Click **New environment** → name it exactly `pub.dev`
3. Under **Deployment protection rules**:
   - Check **Required reviewers** → add yourself (and/or your team) as reviewer
   - Uncheck **Allow administrators to bypass configured protection rules**
4. Click **Save protection rules**

> The `pub.dev` environment is required by the publish workflow. Protection rules ensure that every publish requires manual approval, preventing accidental releases.

## Releasing (two stages)

Releasing happens in **two independent stages**, each with its own command and git
tag — the `openmls_frb` native crate and the `openmls` Dart package
are versioned and released separately.

1. **Native crate (stage 1)** — from a clean, up-to-date `main`:
   ```bash
   make release-frb ARGS="--version X.Y.Z"
   ```
   Bumps `rust/Cargo.toml`, stamps the CHANGELOG highlight, and creates a
   **signed** commit + tag `openmls_frb-X.Y.Z`, then pushes. The tag triggers
   the native build workflow, which builds and publishes the platform binaries.
   The commit/tag/push inherit your terminal, so you enter your signing passphrase
   interactively during the command.

2. **Dart package (stage 2)** — after the native build succeeds:
   ```bash
   make release ARGS="--version X.Y.Z"
   ```
   Verifies the stage-1 `openmls_frb-<crate>` release exists, validates with
   a publish dry-run (on the clean, pre-bump tree), bumps `pubspec.yaml`,
   finalizes the CHANGELOG (`[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z]` + compare links; no empty
   `[Unreleased]` is left behind — the next unreleased change recreates it), then
   creates a **signed** commit + tag `vX.Y.Z` and pushes. `publish.yml` publishes
   to pub.dev.

   > **Do not delete the footer `[Unreleased]:` compare link** even when no
   > `## [Unreleased]` heading is present between releases — it is load-bearing
   > (the release scripts read it for the base URL and previous version, and the
   > next unreleased change re-references it). It is intentionally retained, not
   > stale.

**Order matters:** stage 1 must finish first — the published package's build hook
downloads the precompiled `openmls_frb-<crate>` binary, so it must already
exist before you tag the pub.dev release.

> Automated openmls update PRs **do not** bump the `openmls_frb`
> crate or build binaries — dependency updates accumulate on `main` (tested from
> source in CI), and you cut a native release deliberately with `make release-frb`.

## Repository rulesets & tag protection

The intended configuration uses GitHub **repository rulesets** and a
required-reviewer **environment** so native releases cannot be published without
the right role and review.

**Current status (verified 2026-07-22):** the live fork has no repository
rulesets, and its `native-build` environment has no protection rules, reviewers,
or deployment-branch policy. The list below is the target configuration, not a
description of protections currently active:

- **Signed commits** required on all branches (configure SSH or GPG signing).
- **`main`** protected (changes land via PR; force-push and deletion blocked).
- **Tags** — all tags creatable only by Admins/Maintainers and must be signed;
  the release-triggering `openmls_frb-*` / `v*` are the critical subset (they
  start native / pub.dev publishing).
- The **native-build publish** waits on a required reviewer (the `native-build`
  environment), mirroring the `pub.dev` environment that gates pub.dev publishing.

The maintainer runbook — what each ruleset does, exact `gh` commands to apply /
verify / roll back, and how to configure the `native-build` environment — is in
[`.github/rulesets/README.md`](.github/rulesets/README.md).

## Security Considerations

This is a **cryptographic library**. Security is paramount.

### Reporting Security Issues

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report security issues privately via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.

### Security Review Checklist

For code changes:

- [ ] No hardcoded keys or secrets
- [ ] No key material in logs or error messages
- [ ] `Openmls.init()` called before any operations
- [ ] `':memory:'` databases used only for testing (not production)
- [ ] Encryption key stored in platform secure storage
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full security guidelines.

## Questions?

- Open an issue for general questions
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
